// Now Playing feed, loaded into /usr/bin/perl.
//
// Since macOS 15.4 the mediaremoted daemon answers only clients it trusts, so
// an ordinary app gets an empty dictionary no matter what it asks. Claiming the
// `com.apple.mediaremote.external-access` entitlement does not help either: it
// is restricted, and a process that claims it without Apple's authorization is
// killed at launch.
//
// /usr/bin/perl, however, is a platform binary (Platform identifier=16) that
// the daemon does trust, and it is signed without library validation — so it
// can load this dylib. Running the MediaRemote calls from inside that process
// yields the full record: title, artist, album, duration, position, artwork.
//
// The helper prints one JSON object per line on stdout and takes commands on
// stdin. It exits as soon as stdin closes, so it can never outlive Cyclop.
